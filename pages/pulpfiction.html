    <opinion> <!--Opinion text goes here-->
        <p>A great tale of the more down-to-earth and modern day struggles of various individuals trying to make the better of their situations despite everything trying
            to prevent them doing otherwise. Big fan of the various story arcs the characters go through, and Sameul L. Jackson absolutely steals the show in some of the most
            memorable and quotable sequences out there.
