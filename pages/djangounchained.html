    <opinion>
        <p>On top of a rather visceral and down to earth portrayal of the struggles of a period in American History, the story of the resolve of the main character, Django, in his search is a work of art.
            And the chemistry between him and Dr. Schultz makes for one of the most entertaining on screen duos out there.
